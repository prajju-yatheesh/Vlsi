# UART Protocol Design and Verification

## üîß Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and verification of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)** protocol using System Verilog. UART is a widely used serial communication protocol in embedded systems.

The goal is to implement a fully functional UART transmitter and receiver module and verify their correctness through testbenches and simulations.

## üß† Objectives
- Design UART Transmitter and Receiver modules using  System Verilog/VHDL
- Simulate and verify functional correctness using testbenches
- Understand asynchronous serial communication
- Ensure proper baud rate, parity, and stop bit handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **HDL**: System Verilog 
- **Simulation**:  Icarus Verilog
- **Waveform Viewer**: GTKWave or equivalent
- **Synthesis Tool**: EDA Playground
